# VeevaBonusTask

As asked, automated a testcase i.e., a happy flow - with all valid values
I used Cucumber BDD farmework and passed the values through feature file it self, however if the data is huge, i could have used excel sheets. 
but since this test case deals with 4 parameters, i used feature file, exmaples to do it.
Included a screenshot after result generation and implemented log4j
